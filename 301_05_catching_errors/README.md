PROJECT: Catching Errors


Revisit the projects you've worked on in the previous sections and add exception handling to make them more secure.

For example, you can read up on requests exceptions and make sure your scraper correctly handles a situation where no Internet connection could be established, or the site you're trying to scrape has been shut down.

You can also create custom exceptions to handle specific user inputs for your CLI game projects and make sure that the program doesn't quit when it shouldn't and stops when you want it to.
