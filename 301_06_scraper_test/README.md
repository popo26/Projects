PROJECT: Scraper Tests

After writing a unittest test suite for your web scraper throughout this course section, you'll continue to train your test development some more.

For this project, you are tasked to write a test suite for the CLI game you've been building throughout the course. You can use unittest or pytest for it.

Adding a test suite to your code will make your program much more professional:


Training to build another test suite using TDD will also give you good practice to work in a test-driven approach and understand what it takes to create a solid code base.
