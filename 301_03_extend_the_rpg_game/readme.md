PROJECT: Extend The RPG Game

With some yummy soup in your belly, it's time to return to your game world:

For this project, you'll continue to improve your command-line RPG game by adding inheritance to your code:

Create at least two child classes to your Opponent() class:
a weak opponent
a final boss
Think about what these two child classes should have in common, and where they should differ.
Implement at least an .attack() method in your Opponent() class, that both of the child classes override in different ways.
Override the __init__() method of at least one of your two child classes so that it adds another attribute to your child class that the parent class doesn't have.
Remember to brainstorm and map out your ideas on paper before starting to code. Having a relatively good idea of what you want to do beforehand makes your code more concise and your coding more effective.

Can you find another aspect of your game that you can improve using inheritance?
