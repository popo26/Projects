PROJECT: Build A Card Game
In this project, you'll create your own classes that allow you to model card games. Then, you'll use these classes to build a game.

Note: This project is meant to be a challenge. Push yourself and attempt to complete it in order to synthesize your learning and apply your knowledge practically. If you have questions, post on your forum.
Start by planning this project out using pencil and paper. Scribble ideas in your notebook and think about what classes you might need, which ones can inherit from another class, which operators do you want to implement, etc. Draw, write, scribble. Do whatever you need to do to get your brain going and draft a rough idea of what you'll need and how you'll approach this task.

Then start to write your custom classes.

Once you're done, try to build a card game that uses the classes you created. Share the game you built on your forum.
