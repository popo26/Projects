# python201_project_02_adventure_game

##This is an improved version of adventure game from python101

###Pseudocode from 10

1.Build a CLI RPG game following the instructions from the course.
2.Ask the player for their name.
3.Display a message that greets them and introduces them to the game world.
4.Present them with a choice between two doors.
5.If they choose the left door, they'll see an empty room.
6.If they choose the right door, then they encounter a dragon.
7.In both cases, they have the option to return to the previous room or interact further.
8.When in the seemingly empty room, they can choose to look around. If they do so, they will find a sword. 
9.They can choose to take it or leave it.
10.When encountering the dragon, they have the choice to fight it.
11.If they have the sword from the other room, then they will be able to defeat it and win the game.
12.If they don't have the sword, then they will be eaten by the dragon and lose the game

###Pseudocode from 201

1.Save the user input options you allow e.g. in a set that you can check against when your user makes a choice.
2.Create an inventory for your player, where they can add and remove items.
3.Players should be able to collect items they find in rooms and add them to their inventory.
4.If they lose a fight against the dragon, then they should lose their inventory items.
5.Add more rooms to your game and allow your player to explore.
6.Some rooms can be empty, others can contain items, and yet others can contain an opponent.
7.Implement some logic that decides whether or not your player can beat the opponent depending on what items they have in their inventory
8.Use the random module to add a multiplier to your battles, similar to a dice roll in a real game. This pseudo-random element can have an effect on whether your player wins or loses when battling an opponent.
